Hi! I am an ecologist broadly interested in the biogeography and dispersal of microorganisms, with a special love for understanding the soil fungi and bacteria that are so integral to soil health. Relatedly, I am also fascinated by host-microbiome relationships and how these may scale up to affect ecosystem functioning. Other than my research, I enjoy exploring Coloradoâ€™s mountains every way I can, gardening native plants, crafting, and reading nerdy books.

I am a PhD candidate co-advised by Noah Fierer and Julian Resasco at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Currently, I am also a Graduate Research Award Fellow through the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). My dissertation research focuses on the spatial patterns of microorganisms in the soil and near-surface atmosphere, considering physiological traits and environmental conditions including habitat fragmentation to understand why microbes are where they are.
