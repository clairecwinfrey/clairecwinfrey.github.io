I am an ecologist broadly interested in the biogeography of microorganisms, with a special love for soil fungi and bacteria. I am currently a PhD candidate co-advised by Noah Fierer and Julian Resasco at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. My dissertation research focuses on the spatial patterns of microorganisms in the soil and near-surface atmosphere, considering physiological traits and environmental conditions including habitat fragmentation to understand why microbes are where they are. Other than my research, I enjoy exploring Coloradoâ€™s mountains every way I can, gardening, crafting, and reading nerdy books.
